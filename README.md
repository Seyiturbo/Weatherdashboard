# Weather Dashboard
Eight Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX

For this task, my objective is to develop a straightforward weather dashboard, incorporating the utilization of the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library for efficient handling of date and time functionalities effectively. 


## Acceptance Criteria

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city




# Utilization

 Open this link [this page](https://seyiturbo.github.io/Weatherdashboard/) in your browser. The weather dashboard will open and then input your desired location. At the moment, the weather dashboard index file broke although the weather app is working fine. Working on fixing the dashboard as soon as possible.
